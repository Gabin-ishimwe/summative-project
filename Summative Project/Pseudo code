In this project we are going to create an algorithm that will help a clinic store covid-19 test data of patients
we will implement this project using a python module called 'tkinter',
this module will help us create a Graphic User Interface(GUI) which will our user to fill in their inputs and stores them.
we will also use functions, classes and dictionary to implement this algorithm


*importing tkinter
we will need to import tkinter module package which will help us create a GUI for our project
*importing datetime
we will need also to import datetime module as it will help us know each exact time our user stores information

we will initialize the tkinter package through a command code root = TK() and root.mainloop()
between these two lines of codes it is where we will create GUI for our user
*root = Tk()


create class storage:

    method init():
        initialize all these following instance variables
        instance variable 1
        * we write a code using this package which create a user input the clinic name

        instance variable 2
        * we write a code using this package which create a user input where the use will put their first name

        instance variable 3
        * we write a code using this package which create a user input where the user will put their last name

        instance variable 4
        * we will write another code using this package where the user will enter the name of the age

        instance variable 5
        * we will write another code using this package where the user will enter their gender

        instance variable 6
        * we will write another code using this package where the user will enter their nationality

        instance variable 7
        * we will write another code using this package where the user will enter their date of birth

        instance variable 8
        * we will write another code using this package where the user will enter their phone number

        instance variable 9
        * we will write another code using this package where the user will enter their test code

        instance variable 10
        * we write a code using this package which create a user input where the use will put their first name

        instance variable 11
        * we will create a dictionary which will store user input data


    we will create a function for this button to perform that command of storing information
    method store():
    this method contains codes that will tell the button to perform(run) codes in this section

        * instance variable 11(dictionary).append(instance variable1)(clinic name)
        *instance variable 11(dictionary).append(instance variable 2)(first name)
        *instance variable 11(dictionary).append(instance variable 3)(last name)
        *instance variable 11(dictionary).append(instance variable 4)(gender)
                .                                       .
                .                                       .
                .                                       .


    as the user click the button after inputing the data, those information will be stored(appended) in the dictionary

    this method will command our button to store every information in our dictionary

    method textfile():
    this method will create a textfile and give it mode of appending "a"
        *file = open(textfile.txt, a)
        *file.write(""
        instance variable 11(dictionary)[][0]
        instance variable 11(dictionary)[][1]
        instance variable 11(dictionary)[][2]
        instance variable 11(dictionary)[][3]
                .
                .
                .

        "")
    in this textfile each time the user click the button after inputing every data in the dictionary, it will append(write) that data in the textfile

    the textfile will store those data each time the user click the button after inputing every data


* create a button using tkinter package and give it a command to call the method store() which will perform all the codes in that method
this means that each time the user clicks the button, that button will perform (run) all those codes.
*root.mainloop()



TEST CASE

* import unittest module

class Test:
    method 1:
    check if the user inputs collect datatypes in each input field

    method 2:
    check what happens when the user doesn't input any data and clicks the button to submit

    method 3:
    check if all the information filled in the input field is stored in the text file

    method 4:
    check the password input if it is correct in give attempts we specified the program
