# PROGRAM OVERVIEW
we create a program in which a clinic or hospital will input data on patient who got covid test,
and stores their information background in some sort of storage for purpose of recording.

to use this program you need first to input the entity name (clinic name) and password so that you can proceed to fill in data on patient
#entity name: "clinic"  -- lowercase letters no spacing!!!
#password: "covid data storage" -- lowercase letter with spacing between each word!!!

# special tools used
to build this program we used a special python package called #tkinter
this package helps developers to create Graphic User Interface(GUI) in python, it also helps the user interact well with the program with no incoveniences

we used another package called #os
this package opened us a notepad for us after finishing inputting every in the form, to help us see where the data went in the storage and look also for other previous information in the storage

# exception handling
we handled exceptions in our program such as where a used might input incorrect data like gender or incorrect data type like dates or age, we used message boxes in tkinter package to show the user the problem with the inputs and he/she can't proceed or submit withouf soliving those problem,
this prevent our program from crashing and storing incorrect information.
Hence our program will only accept or store correct data and datatype inputs


# testing
we created test scenarios for our program to test if it works well such as testing input field when user input incorrect data and datatype of different entries.

in this program we can't test our exception handling because when they raise, the program create messageboxed for the user
to recognize where he made an input error, and the user can not proceed or submit anything without first solving that issue(error)
testing this exception can not be possible because the program will allow the user to input correct answers or inputs!!


# N.B
after inputing every data in the form and and submit the form, close the program or window (everything), a notepad will be opened for you to see that you inputed stored.
